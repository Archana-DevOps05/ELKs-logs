# Log Monitoring with ELK Stack
# Goal
The aim of this project is to implement centralized logging for better monitoring, troubleshooting, and analysis by using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Logs from applications will be collected, processed, and visualized for efficient insights.
# Tech Stack
Elasticsearch: Stores and indexes logs

Logstash: Processes and forwards logs

Kibana: Visualizes logs with dashboards

Filebeat: Collects logs from applications

Docker: Containerizes the ELK Stack
